## Demo Script (7-8 minutes)

### Opening (30s)
"Today I'm showing you the Pathway Planner - a tool for planning Teesside's transport decarbonization using real UK emissions data. This tool helps us find optimal pathways to reduce emissions while considering costs and constraints."

### Dashboard (1m)
"Here's our dashboard showing key metrics. We can see total scenarios, optimized pathways, COâ‚‚ reduction targets, and cost savings. The sample chart shows what a typical decarbonization pathway looks like."

### Scenarios (2m)
"Let me load some demo scenarios. We have three different approaches with different vehicle types:
- **Conservative Pathway:** Focuses on cars and buses with gradual transition
- **Accelerated Transition:** Adds vans for faster adoption of electric/hydrogen
- **Net Zero by 2040:** Includes all vehicle types for aggressive timeline

Notice how we can select specific vehicle types and see their real emissions factors from UK data."

### Optimization (2m)
"Now let's run optimization. This uses linear programming to find the optimal fuel mix that minimizes emissions while meeting our constraints. The tool considers the different emissions profiles of each vehicle type and fuel combination."

### Results (1m)
"Here are the results. We can see emissions decreasing over time, costs changing, and detailed fuel mix breakdowns for each vehicle type. The optimization considers real-world constraints like maximum annual change rates."

### Closing (30s)
"This tool gives us data-driven insights for transport planning using real UK emissions data. We can compare different scenarios, understand trade-offs between vehicle types, and make informed decisions about Teesside's transport future."
